I approached this assignment linearly. I coded the methods in the order that the user would 
come across them playing the game. 

I am aware that certain methods return something and I don't use it. I did that because Professor 
Christman made those method templates and there were comments that said it should return something,
so I decided to return it anyways in case she's looking for that. I believed it was not the best way to
structure my code those so I do not use the variables I return in the driver. I prefered the print statements.

I also have getter methods for several variables, more than Professor Christman probably wants us to have. I 
like it because it feels cleaner.

Hope you enjoy my game!
